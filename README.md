# puro

puro is a template-based C++ sound engine library. It is intended to work as a basis for granular synths, samplers, game audio engines etc.

The library tries to get in your way as little as possible, and merely tries to provide a set of structs and helper functions typically encountered in an audio engine.
As it is also a learning project, expect it to break with every commit.
